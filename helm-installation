‚ö†Ô∏è Note:
After creating the cluster, we need to give IAM EC2 full access or admin access to the node group IAM role.
Only then the EBS volume can be created by the node in EKS.

üì¶ Step 2: Install CSI Driver in EKS Cluster
After connecting to your EKS cluster, follow these steps:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Add AWS EBS CSI driver repo
helm repo add aws-ebs-csi-driver https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-ebs-csi-driver

# Update the Helm repo
helm repo update

# (Installation command for CSI driver would follow here)
